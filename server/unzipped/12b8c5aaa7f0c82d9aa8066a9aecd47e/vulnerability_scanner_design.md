# Vulnerability Scanner Agent Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design for a vulnerability scanning agent built using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK). The agent will collect vulnerability data from multiple sources including CVE.org, EPSS, and CISA KEV, and provide patch links when available.

## Architecture

### 1. Core Components
- **Main Agent**: Orchestrates the scanning process and integrates results
- **Data Collection Tools**: Custom function tools for each data source
- **Patch Link Finder**: Tool to locate patch information for vulnerabilities
- **Result Formatter**: Formats and prioritizes vulnerability information

### 2. Data Sources
- **CVE Database**: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (primary source)
- **EPSS**: Exploit Prediction Scoring System (likelihood of exploitation)
- **CISA KEV**: Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog (actively exploited vulnerabilities)
- **Vendor Security Advisories**: For patch information

### 3. Tool Implementation

#### CVE Data Collection Tool
```python
from google.adk.tools import LongRunningFunctionTool

def cve_data_collector(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    Collects vulnerability information from the CVE database.
    
    Args:
        cve_id (str, optional): Specific CVE ID to search for
        keywords (list, optional): List of keywords to search for
        date_range (dict, optional): Date range for vulnerability publication
        
    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary containing vulnerability information
    """
    # Setup
    yield {"status": "pending", "message": "Initializing CVE data collection"}
    
    # Perform data collection
    # ...
    
    # Return results
    return {"status": "completed", "result": cve_data}

# Create the tool
cve_tool = LongRunningFunctionTool(func=cve_data_collector)
```

#### EPSS Score Collection Tool
```python
from google.adk.tools import LongRunningFunctionTool

def epss_score_collector(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    Collects exploit prediction scores from EPSS.
    
    Args:
        cve_ids (list): List of CVE IDs to get scores for
        
    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary mapping CVE IDs to their EPSS scores
    """
    # Setup
    yield {"status": "pending", "message": "Initializing EPSS score collection"}
    
    # Perform data collection
    # ...
    
    # Return results
    return {"status": "completed", "result": epss_scores}

# Create the tool
epss_tool = LongRunningFunctionTool(func=epss_score_collector)
```

#### CISA KEV Data Collection Tool
```python
from google.adk.tools import LongRunningFunctionTool

def cisa_kev_collector(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    Collects known exploited vulnerabilities from CISA KEV catalog.
    
    Args:
        cve_ids (list, optional): List of specific CVE IDs to check
        date_range (dict, optional): Date range for KEV additions
        
    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary containing KEV information
    """
    # Setup
    yield {"status": "pending", "message": "Initializing CISA KEV data collection"}
    
    # Perform data collection
    # ...
    
    # Return results
    return {"status": "completed", "result": kev_data}

# Create the tool
kev_tool = LongRunningFunctionTool(func=cisa_kev_collector)
```

#### Patch Link Finder Tool
```python
from google.adk.tools import LongRunningFunctionTool

def patch_link_finder(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    Finds patch links for vulnerabilities.
    
    Args:
        cve_id (str): CVE ID to find patches for
        vendor (str, optional): Specific vendor to search for
        
    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary containing patch information and links
    """
    # Setup
    yield {"status": "pending", "message": "Searching for patch information"}
    
    # Search for patch information
    # ...
    
    # Return results
    return {"status": "completed", "result": patch_links}

# Create the tool
patch_tool = LongRunningFunctionTool(func=patch_link_finder)
```

### 4. Agent Integration

```python
from google.adk import Agent, Runner
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService

# Create the agent with tools
agent = LlmAgent(
    instructions="""
    You are a vulnerability scanning agent that helps users find information about 
    security vulnerabilities from multiple sources including CVE.org, EPSS, and CISA KEV.
    You can also find patch links when available.
    
    When a user asks about a vulnerability:
    1. Search for the vulnerability in the CVE database
    2. Get the EPSS score to determine exploitation likelihood
    3. Check if it's in the CISA KEV catalog (actively exploited)
    4. Find patch links if available
    5. Present the information in a prioritized, easy-to-understand format
    """,
    tools=[cve_tool, epss_tool, kev_tool, patch_tool]
)

# Create a runner with session service
runner = Runner(
    agent=agent,
    session_service=InMemorySessionService()
)
```

## Data Flow

1. User provides a vulnerability identifier (CVE ID) or search criteria
2. Agent invokes the CVE data collection tool to gather basic vulnerability information
3. For each CVE found, the agent invokes:
   - EPSS tool to get exploitation probability scores
   - CISA KEV tool to check if it's a known exploited vulnerability
   - Patch link finder to locate remediation information
4. Agent combines and prioritizes the information
5. Results are presented to the user with vulnerabilities sorted by severity and exploitation risk

## Prioritization Logic

Vulnerabilities will be prioritized based on:
1. Presence in CISA KEV (highest priority - actively exploited)
2. EPSS score (higher scores indicate greater likelihood of exploitation)
3. CVSS score (standard severity rating)
4. Availability of patches (vulnerabilities without patches are higher priority)

## Implementation Considerations

1. **API Rate Limiting**: Implement backoff strategies for external APIs
2. **Caching**: Cache results to minimize redundant API calls
3. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle API failures and provide partial results
4. **Asynchronous Processing**: Use LongRunningFunctionTool for non-blocking operations
5. **Result Formatting**: Present information in a clear, actionable format

## Next Steps

1. Implement the CVE data collection tool
2. Implement the EPSS score collection tool
3. Implement the CISA KEV data collection tool
4. Implement the patch link finder
5. Integrate components into the ADK agent
6. Test and validate the agent
7. Document usage and deployment instructions
